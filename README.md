Repo Madness: Taming the Teenage Open-Source Repository
=======================================================

Presentation for [NSMeetup, June 2014](http://www.meetup.com/nsmeetup/events/183632692):

> Everyone knows the kinds of things a newborn repo needs to flourish in today's
open-source landscape--things like a LICENSE, README, and of course Cocoapods 
support. But what kind of care does a repo need as it gains users--and tech debt?
In this talk, Jeff will discuss tools and techniques for keeping users happy and
maintainers sane as projects grow, using his project Subliminal as an example.

The presentation was built for [Deckset](http://www.decksetapp.com/) using the 
Zurich Gray theme. If you just want the rendered slides, check out the PDF. 
Unfortunately, it doesn't include presenters' notes, so you may want to read the 
raw Markdown.
